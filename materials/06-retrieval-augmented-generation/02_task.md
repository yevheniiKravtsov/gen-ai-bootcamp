# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## ðŸ“š Learning Objectives
- Understand what is Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- Learn how to use embeddings with RAG

## ðŸ“‘ Task

### Use the tasks project from module 01
For this task use the results from the previous task as a basis for new changes.

### Goal
You need to implement a simple application that uses RAG approach to generate text based on the knowledge source. 
We do not impose any restrictions on the approach to application development. 
You can write a console or web application, you can use any database, etc...
You can use functions or just retrieve knowledge in the method and add it as a context in query that you are sending to the model.

We only have two requirements for the application.:
- Application should have ability to upload new information and use it as a knowledge source.
- Application should have ability to generate text based on the knowledge sources.

### Closing
Create a screenshot of the workflow showing the checks have passed and attach this screenshot to your tasks on learn.epam.com.

### Evaluation Criteria
1. Text Generation Based on Knowledge Sources 
- Implemented the ability to generate text based on the uploaded knowledge sources (40%)
- Verified that the generated text is relevant and accurate based on the knowledge sources (40%)

2. Functionality Testing
- Application runs without errors (10%)
- Responses are generated correctly and are relevant to the prompts (10%)
